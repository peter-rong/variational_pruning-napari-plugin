# variational_pruning-napari-plugin

## About

This repo is a napari plugin that features variational pruning -- a new algorithm to prune medial axis in 2D. The plugin serves as a visualization tool to help users better view the output of the pruned medial axis. The plugin also allows user to compare variational pruning's performance against an existing classic pruning metric (Erosion Thickness).

This repo is also the code repo for paper: Variational Pruning of Medial Axes of Planar Shapes (Eurographics Symposium on Geometry Processing 2023)
